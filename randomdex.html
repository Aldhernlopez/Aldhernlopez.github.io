                    <b>Randomdex</b> - An App that Generates a Random Pokémon each time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This a novelty app that has no real purpose, lol. 
                    Like the name suggests, it generates the details of a random Pokémon each time and displays it to the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app makes use of PokéAPI, so it will need Internet permission to work as intended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app has been developed and debugged for android smartphones - it's not possible to use it on
                    web or iOS.
                    Possible versions of this app might be made availabe in the future (not a priority, so it will probably
                    take some time).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Future Updates will be bringing in additional info for each Pokémon - like Evolution chain, etc.
                    Other features like better UI, Pokémon description etc will also be made available with the help of updates in the future.
                </p>
                <p>

                        <b>My Notes:</b> This is a fun app that I built to learn how to handle API calls and responses from the internet.
                        I've used Flutter and PokéAPI to make this app work.
                        I've enjoyed watching Pokémon in my childhood, so I thought I'd relive those days by building something related to it.
                        This app is meant to resemble the functionalities of an actual Pokédex, but some features turned out to be a bit more complex that the current me couldn't handle.
                        Once I've figured out those nuances, I will surely be updating to bring those changes to life. 
                        There's a lot more data from the response recieved from PokéAPI, which would be a shame to not make use of, lol.
                        Once again, I do appreciate you checking another one of my work out.
                        Have a Wonderful Day!
