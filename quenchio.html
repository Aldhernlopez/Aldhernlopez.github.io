                        Important Discalimer: This is meant to be an informative app, and not something that promotes alcoholism. <br />
                        This app is in it's early development phase, so the deployment might take a while.

                <p>
                    This app is meant to introduce various drinks to the user.
                    It provides the recipe for making drinks - both alcoholic and non alcoholic kinds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There won't be any ads like in my previous apps, since monetization isn't in my plans for this app.
                    I'll also be trying to have a simple and aesthetic UI in the app.
                    The user will also have to consent to using this app when opening for the first time, since alcoholism isn't promoted in any way through the usage of this app.
                    It's purpose is to let the users know the recipes to various kinds of drinks out there.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The app will be made using Flutter, and as of now the plans for this app doesn't call for a backend service.
                    Periodic updates will be released in order to bring in more recipes, if available.

                        <b>My Notes:</b> This is the first app I've developed for the purpose of publishing, so it may
                        not be the best app that provides the same features out there.
                        I focused more on the functionalities more than on UI and UX, so the experience might not be
                        upto your expectations.
                        I am open to listening to your feedbacks, so I could make this app better.
                        I plan on keeping the app updated periodically, adding new features and improvements each time.
                        It will also remain ad-free forever - that's a genuine promise.
                        I didn't create this app to help me out financially - it's meant to be an app to help keep my
                        finances in check. So I found no reason to have ads in it.
                        If you feel like contributing something to me, you can literally buy me a coffee and I'll be
                        grateful, lol.
                        Do let me know the feedbacks and suggestions for improving this app - and I will try to
                        implement those with the best of my abilities.
                        Thank you for checking my work out.
                        I wish you a wonderful day!
