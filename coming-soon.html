								Hey there!
							</p>
							<p>
								I appreciate you taking time out of your schedule to check out my works. 
								It does mean a lot to me. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Unfortunately, this app isn't out for public use just yet. 
								Being a solo dev, it does take some time to get everything to work as intended.
								Sometimes adding certain features and debugging etc takes way more time than anticipated - and that pushes the deployment of the app down the line.
								This delay could also be caused by stuff happening in my day to day life - something that one can't really predict.
							</p>
							<p>
								i do apologise sincerely for this delay. 
								Rest be assured, I do plan on releasing all the apps at some point in time.
								You can always check my socials to see whether or not something has been released - there's a chance I'll forget to update this portfolio with the right link, lol.
								You can also reach out to me directly if you've got queries regarding the details of one of my projects (or anything else for that matter).
							</p>
							<p>
								Here's a quick look at the status of the apps that I've been working on (as of December 3, 2023):
								<ul>
									<li>
										<b>Coin Compass: </b>99% of the work has been completed. Only minor work pending. Soon to be deployed.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Randomdex: </b>99% of the work has been completed. Only minor works pending. Soon to be deployed.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Deadline Sync: </b>UI work has been completed. Working on the backend stuff. Currently focusing on this project.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Terranova: </b> UI designing phase. 
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Quenchio: </b> UI designing phase. Next on the list to be worked on.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Quiz-Zone for Chill-Zone: </b> UI designing phase.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
								I once again thank you for being here. 
								It does bring a smile in my face seeing you checking on the work I've been doing.
								I'm all ears in case you have any suggestions or criticisms regarding any of these - do let me know your thoughts.
							</p>
							<p>
								<i>Have a nice day!</i>
