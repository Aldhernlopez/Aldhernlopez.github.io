                    <b>Netflix Clone</b> - The UI of the app for the popular streaming service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app is a basic UI clone of the Netflix app - with some minor adjustments and alterations made from my side.
                    This is based on the tutorial posted by Brototype and a design I came across on Figma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's not an exact copy of the stuff seen on the tutorial - I only used it as a reference to see how close I was to the standard they used while building the app.
                    As of now, only the UI part is completed - with dummy data.
                    The real app will display data provided by TheMovieDB.
                    Unfortunately, TRAI has blocked TheMovieDB for some reason, so getting the app to work without stuff like VPN would be impossible.
                    Also, the tutorial videos I mentioned are incomplete, and uses Bloc which seems a bit too complicated to me as of the moment.
                    I am trying to figure out how to do the data fetching using state management like Provider.
                    I'll share the source code on Github when I'm done with that part as well.
                </p>
