                    Behold - <b>Coin Compass</b> - Your navigator on your journey towards Financial Responsibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app was created to help one keep track of their finances.
                    It may not look like much, but the app works as intended, and more features are set to come in the future. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this day and age where apps and services try to gather as much Personal Information as they could, this app stands out.
                    Every data saved on the app is saved locally, this means no third person will have access to the financial details entered by the user.
                    This does come with a catch though - by saving data locally, you are susceptible to lose all that information if you uninstall the app, clear the app data, or upgrade your devices.
                    A potential fix to this has been thought of, and will be implemented in a later update. 
                    Do keep an eye out for the updates. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app has been developed and debugged for android smartphones - it's not possible to use it on web or iOS.
                    Possible versions of this app might be availabe in the future (not a priority, so it will probably take some time).
                </p>
                <p>
                    A couple of the features that will be implemented in later updates include:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Edit Feature.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        View the Selected Transaction in Detail.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Detailed Breakdown of All Transactions in the Stats Page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data Migration Feature.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Improved UI.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>

                        <b>My Notes:</b> This is the first app I've developed for the purpose of publishing, so it may not be the best app that provides the same features out there.
                        Made using Flutter and makes use of Hive for local data storage.
                        I focused more on the functionalities more than on UI and UX, so the experience might not be upto your expectations.
                        I am open to listening to your feedbacks, so I could make this app better.
                        I plan on keeping the app updated periodically, adding new features and improvements each time.
                        It will also remain ad-free forever - that's a genuine promise.
                        I didn't create this app to help me out financially - it's meant to be an app to help keep my finances in check. So I found no reason to have ads in it.
                        If you feel like contributing something to me, you can literally buy me a coffee and I'll be grateful, lol.
                        Do let me know the feedbacks and suggestions for improving this app - and I will try to implement those with the best of my abilities.
                        Thank you for checking my work out.
                        I wish you a wonderful day!
