                    <b>Deadline Sync</b> - Stay Ahead of Your Deadlines
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app is designed to help you track all the deadlines in your lives.
                    With it's simple UI, keeping track of deadlines have never been easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users are able to add various types of deadlines and the app will keep track of all such deadlines.
                    By implementing local notification system, users will be getting notified when any deadline is about to be met.
                    Firebase is used to host the backend of the app, so data migration is made possible for the users.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                    This app has been developed and debugged for android smartphones - it's not possible to use it on
                    web or iOS.
                    Possible versions of this app might be availabe in the future (not a priority, so it will probably
                    take some time).

                        <b>My Notes:</b> This is the third app that I've been working on. 
                        This app is made using Flutter and utilizes functionalities of Firebase and Cloudstore.
                        As of writing this (31st January 2024), I've completed around 75% of the UI part of the app.
                        The backend stuff will definitely take some time, so this app could be ready in around 3-4 months
                        (Delay would've been shorter, but since I'm juggling between a few projects to keep things fresh it probably would take some time).
                        Let me know if you need a heads up when this drops.
                        Again, sorry for the delay.
