                <p>
                    <b>Chronosync</b> - Stay Ahead of Your Deadlines
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app is designed to help you track all the deadlines in your lives.
                    With it's simple UI, keeping track of deadlines have never been easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users are able to add various types of activities and deadlines and the app will keep track of tem all.
                    By implementing local notification system, users will be getting notified when any deadline is about to be met.
                    Isar is used to provide the backend services, so all data is saved locally. 
                    Future updates would bring in features like homescreen widgets and data migration services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Edit: As of today (27 March, 2024), I've found out that there's a technical issue that prevents the notifications sent to the user.
                    It's an issue that has to be worked on by Flutter and it hasn't been resolved yet, so I had to stop working on the local storage version of this app.
                    I am instead gonna work on an online version of this app, which works with Firebase and Cloudstore. 
                    The basic working version of this app (with a rough and unfinished looking UI, might I add) has been pushed to a Github repository and is made public accessible.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                    This app has been developed and debugged for android smartphones - it's not possible to use it on
                    web or iOS.
                    Possible versions of this app might be availabe in the future (not a priority, so it will probably
                    take some time).
                </p> -->

                        <b>My Notes:</b> This is the third app that I've been working on. 
                        The app version made using Flutter and Isar DB has been published on my Github and can be found there.
                        Due to a few technical issues, I am forced to make the app an online one, and so the development time is again gonna increase.
                        Let me know if you need a heads up when this drops.
                        Again, sorry for the delay.
