                    <b>Chronosync</b> - Stay Ahead of Your Deadlines
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app is designed to help you track all the deadlines in your lives.
                    With it's simple UI, keeping track of deadlines have never been easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users are able to add various types of activities and deadlines and the app will keep track of tem all.
                    By implementing local notification system, users will be getting notified when any deadline is about to be met.
                    Isar is used to provide the backend services, so all data is saved locally. 
                    Future updates would bring in features like homescreen widgets and data migration services.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                    This app has been developed and debugged for android smartphones - it's not possible to use it on
                    web or iOS.
                    Possible versions of this app might be availabe in the future (not a priority, so it will probably
                    take some time).
                </p> -->
                <p>
                    These are some possible features that could be implemented in later updates:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Custom Activity Categories.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Custom Category Images.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        UI Improvements.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <!-- You can check out the app <a href="#">here</a>. -->

                        <b>My Notes:</b> This is the third app that I've been working on. 
                        This app is made using Flutter and utilizes functionalities of Firebase and Cloudstore.
                        Only the backend work is pending, so it won't take much time to push the app release 
                        (Delay would've been shorter, but since I'm juggling between a few projects to keep things fresh it probably would take some time).
                        Let me know if you need a heads up when this drops.
                        Again, sorry for the delay.
