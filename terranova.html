                <p>
                    <b>Terranova</b> - Your Guide To Maintaining A Great Garden
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app is meant to offer my takes and experiences growing certain plants during my gardening journey.
                    It's also meant to help bring out the enterpreneur side of mine by offering propagations from my garden at a reasonable price.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, the idea is for the app to work offline, excluding the shop section.
                    The aim is to bring in features like starring/favouriting care guides, various cart functionalities, etc.
                    Stripe will probably be the payment gateway (unless I come across something else).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app is made with the help of Flutter and will probably be using Firebase as the backend (unless I find a better alternative).
                </p>

                    Possible versions of this app might be availabe in the future (not a priority, so it will probably

                        <b>My Notes:</b> This is the first app I've developed for the purpose of publishing, so it may
                        not be the best app that provides the same features out there.
                        I focused more on the functionalities more than on UI and UX, so the experience might not be
                        upto your expectations.
                        I am open to listening to your feedbacks, so I could make this app better.
                        I plan on keeping the app updated periodically, adding new features and improvements each time.
                        It will also remain ad-free forever - that's a genuine promise.
                        I didn't create this app to help me out financially - it's meant to be an app to help keep my
                        finances in check. So I found no reason to have ads in it.
                        If you feel like contributing something to me, you can literally buy me a coffee and I'll be
                        grateful, lol.
                        Do let me know the feedbacks and suggestions for improving this app - and I will try to
                        implement those with the best of my abilities.
                        Thank you for checking my work out.
                        I wish you a wonderful day!
