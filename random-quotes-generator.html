                    <b>Random Quotes Generator</b> - Get Inspired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app was built as part of an assessment task for a job position I had applied to.
                    It does the task that it was meant to do - generate quotes using an API, save the favorite ones locally, share it with others via email.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built this app with a default dark theme, given the strain the eyes get when browsing in light mode.
                    The API I used is called a Stoic Quote Generator, and every quotes in it are indeed inspiring, lol.
                    I've made sure to have as little information collected from the user, given how important data privacy is at this day and age.
                    That is why the user must enter the recipient email in the default mail app, instead of it being passed on from the app itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can find the app source code on<a href="https://github.com/Aldhernlopez/random_quote_generator">Github</a>.
