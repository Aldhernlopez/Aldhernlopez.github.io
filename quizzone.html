                    <b>Trivia Central</b> - A Quiz Hosting App. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app idea was based on a few instances during quizzes I used to take part/host in a private Discord Server.
                    There were multiple instances where multiple participants guessed the answer at the same time, and the message hierarchy differed in their own devices.
                    So I thought of this app as a means to fix that age old issue, lol.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea is to display a certain number of questions to each of the participants, and then record their individual response time.
                    Since the time will be measured in milliseconds, the chances of two responses happening at the same time will be massively reduced.
                    This custom quiz option will be exclusive to the Discord server, since hosting multiple custom quizzes in case of a large number of userbase could, in theory, create a huge storage bill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It'll also have a guest login feature, where users will be able to take part in a random quiz in a couple of topics available.
                    They will then get an analysis of their performance, while learning more about certain topics.
                    This way, users will be able to get a taste of how the app works, instead of not being to use it at all.
                </p>

                    Possible versions of this app might be availabe in the future (not a priority, so it will probably
                    take some time).

                        <b>My Notes:</b> This is the first app I've developed for the purpose of publishing, so it may
                        not be the best app that provides the same features out there.
                        I focused more on the functionalities more than on UI and UX, so the experience might not be
                        upto your expectations.
                        I am open to listening to your feedbacks, so I could make this app better.
                        I plan on keeping the app updated periodically, adding new features and improvements each time.
                        It will also remain ad-free forever - that's a genuine promise.
                        I didn't create this app to help me out financially - it's meant to be an app to help keep my
                        finances in check. So I found no reason to have ads in it.
                        If you feel like contributing something to me, you can literally buy me a coffee and I'll be
                        grateful, lol.
                        Do let me know the feedbacks and suggestions for improving this app - and I will try to
                        implement those with the best of my abilities.
                        Thank you for checking my work out.
                        I wish you a wonderful day!
